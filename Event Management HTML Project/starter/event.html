        <p>Your event typically will have a start and end time, so putting this information on the invitation email will clear up any questions. If your event spans over the course of a few days, make sure to include start and end times for however many days your event is. Once the event concludes, if you plan on having a happy hour or networking time, adding this to the event invitation email will let your guests know itâ€™s happening. Adding noted time for breaks will also let your guests know when they are free to make phone calls, have a bite to eat, or use the restroom! </p>
